This states that all men, regardless, are equal and should be treated that way.

The reason that organisations like the NKVD, later the KGB could exist is because they were \"defending the revolution\" and therefore necessary. Add in the relentless government propaganda, and a complete isolation from the Western world, and these things could happen, the same way that the death camps of Nazi Germany happened with the approval of the general populace. The reason that the endless queues for bread, the frequent food shortages and famines occurred is because the corrupted ideals of the government, and ironically there was a ruling elite, even on the USSR, because Soviet communism was a poor disguise for totalitarianism. Socialism is also not about oppression, unlike the right says it is. Many things about modern, capitalist and right wing governments are technically socialist, like social security and Medicare in the USA.

Anyway, I personally don't believe BLM is a direct result of ANTIFA's actions, I actually still have yet to see proof rather than conspiracy theory over the statements but I get what you're saying. However with that being said, those who correlate ANTIFA with that of the leftist political party of the United States are actually factually incorrect. Since I've stated my support for the message that BLM protestors represent, I've personally gotten many tweets toward me, many hate messages saying I'm a leftist terrorist this and ANTIFA was something always mentioned. I genuinely thought for a very short period of time that maybe I was doing something wrong or just some dark thoughts of my mind and I decided to do my own research on ANTIFA. What I found out was that they actually don't represent nor support either side of the American spectrum differing from BLM who is made up of people normally with a more left leaning political stance than say the average American citizen. I also discovered that ANTIFA is actually not an organized group enough to be labeled as domestic terrorist as though I thought however Trump has made the official decision so I'm willing to leave this argument in the dust. Now moving on to whatever affiliation most conservatives believe the connection between ANTIFA and BLM are. So I've been kind of searching through and reading through and whilst I was not able to pick up any factual information of these ties, I have gone through a lot of conspiracy theories, some more sensible than others. One that stuck out to me the most was one that I read about as well as one that was advertised through a random YouTube story clip that I accidentally discovered. The theory is that ANTIFA (allegedly funded by George Soro's) comes in behind BLM to worsen BLM's public image as well as follow organized protest to destroy the surrounding area of the demonstration as well as create a riot to paint the picture BLM are some evil organization. Another segment of the theory involved a lot of what conservatives consider fake Main Stream media which is something I'll save for another reply at your request Ms. Cynthia as it is a very long explanation that I myself don't have all the facts to explain in its entirety or factuality in that matter. As to wether or not BLM are actually terrorist? I cannot answer that question however I can provided a rather controversial opinionated statement from my end of the term in which I 100% do not believe they are. I personally am a supporter of the message that BLM spreads and the current social justice movements occurring in our country right now and I have actually never committed a crime before nor an act of treason for that matter. I love my country, I genuinely do it's where my family is from, it's where I was born and it's where I've lived my entire life but we do need reforms more specifically reforms within our police system. I know conservatives think we all want to defend the police but as a BLM supporter who is a rather right-leaning (left-leaning in some aspects) centralist, I can assure from my personal experiences and articles I have read from that side that majority of folks in support of BLM do not actually want the financial strangulation of the national police system rather we/they actually want reforms within the system. Only a minority of leftist or BLM supporters actually want the police system to face a defund rather that's permanent or temporary.", "2020-07-21T22:35:04Z", "2020-07-21T22:35:04Z"], ["@Kiwi Kiwi - Just against these people who promote this BLM,Antifa,KKK and other forms of out right domestic terrorism rubbish.Some of my replies also was removed also.", "2020-07-21T22:18:59Z", "2020-07-21T22:18:59Z"], ["Cynthia Booker Not sure, maybe my replies got deleted.

Based upon research that he had previously done, Doerner hypothesized that the brains of Homosexuals was oriented oppositely from what their phsyical sexual characteristics were. Indeed, he proved this to be true. He found that the casual agent was at least in part due to deficient levels of the hormone testosterone in the host mother at a crucial stage of fetal development when the brain receives its developmental sexual \"orientation\" which then went on to dictate the later-developing physical characteristics of the fetus. Understand, the brain is \"oriented\" BEFORE the sexual organs develop, out of biological necessity. However, if the level of testosterone is deficient in the development of male offspring, then the brain will be mismatched to the LATER sexual development: in short, th Gay males had \"female\" brains. Extending his hypothesis further, Doerner then manipulated the testosterone levels in pregnant rats, and CONSISTENTLY borne male rats which \"mounted\" other male rats as if to mate with them. But the most dramatic confirmation happened when Doerner did an experiment where a control group of both Gay and Straight HUMAN males were injected with a large does of the female hormone estrogen. In a woman, the release of this in a monthly cycle (menstruation) results in a surge of another hormone called \"luteinizing hormone\" (LH) which is responsible for sending a chemical signal to the woman's ovaries to release an egg for possible fertilization. In the results, ONLY THE GAY MALES' BRAINS exhibited this surge of LH hormone -- because they \"expected\" that an ovary would be there to \"receive the signal\". This proved that Doerner was correct in his hypothesis - that true homosexuality is a biological reality dictated by biological mechanisms which could be empirically shown and recorded -- the very basis for Scientific \"proofs\". More recent research has also confirmed this to be true when it was learned that the more male offspring a woman has throughout her life, the higher the odds go that at least one of the latter-born males will, in fact, be Gay, due to the depletion of testosterone as a woman ages. \n\n\nAnyway, so where's Doerner's research? Well, here's where it went awry. Doerner's research came in the 1970s -- the same time when famed Nazi Hunter Elie Wiesel was hunting down some notorious still-living Nazis like Adolf Eichmann, who used to do live experiments on human subjects in the concentration camps. News of the Holocaust was frequent in the news, as were stories on the atrocities of the Nazis for their various evil programs. When Doerner presented his research, he did so with a conclusion that basically characterized Homosexuality as a biological \"defect\" -- and one that could be \"fixed\" or \"bred out of existence\" by the careful monitoring of pregnant mothers at a certain time frame of pregnancy, and by then augmenting their levels of testosterone if found to be low. I hate to say it, but theoretically -- if not ethically -- he was possibly correct. But it was this presumptuous conclusion that doomed Doerner's research, for it smacked too closely of the Nazi \"Eugenics\" program - the creation of a \"master race\" by selective breeding and exterminations. ANd coming from a GERMAN doctor working out of BERLIN, no less, it set off a firestorm that saw his work quickly disavowed and buried by the academic community, which relied HEAVILY then (as it still does now) on public grants and funding from public sources, and could not possibly stand with such an inflammatory report and conclusion. Even Gay groups at the time understandably decried it, for obvious reasons. \n\n\nSubsequent studies have only bolstered the biological basis for this fact. A Karolinska INstitute of Sweden study found that the chemical composition of sweat from Gays was actually more similar to the OPPOSITE biological sex than to their own. ANd notable other studies have found clear differences in size in certain brain parts, -- the hypocampus? -- between Gay and Straight people. Have  you ever read a steamy novel, or maybe a \"Penthouse Forum\" type story and found yourself getting sexually excited by what you were reading? Think about that. Why do you? It's because \"sex\" STARTS IN THE BRAIN. It's not simply a function of your \"parts\", not just a phsyical arousal. It's MENTAL.

The very first, basic contradiction is, of course, the problem of Infinite Regress: if \"God created the Universe, who created \"God\"? You can't just assert that \"God is eternal\" because right there you've made an obvious logical fallacy and moved the goal posts to where the \"supernatural\" just becomes a catch-all excuse for things that you can't logically explain with empirical evidence. \n\nIt's also a fallacy to say that \"...it can be reasonably argued that the Agent C is a personal creator\". No, it can't. A \"personal\" creator would necessarily create something for the benefit of others. And yet no one has EVER explained WHY God would ever \"create\" Humanity -- and yet to screw it up so badly. I mean, if we logically examine the argument, this \"All-Loving, \"All-Caring\", All-Knowing\", All-Powerful, \"All-Merciful God creates a flawed product - Humans - for no other reason than....what exactly? Company? Why would he do that when God supposedly has no form at all? Why would God need an anus, a reproductive system, a belly button, male nipples, a tailbone? So he creates this ignorant, unguided, un-moral human being who doesn't know RIght from Wrong, and God tell them not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge -- as if knowing the difference from Right and Wrong would have been a BAD thing? Well, how did Adam and Eve even KNOW not to disobey God? THEY HAD NO KNOWLEDGE YET!! But here's where it REALLY gets sick -- God not only apparently did not anticipate this, but is now not only going to curse Adam and Ever -- but he's going to curse ALL their innocent descendants, FOR ALL TIME!! Does this sound \"loving\" at all? Does this sound \"Merciful\"? Does this sound like an \"all knowing\" decision or exercise? It's pretty clear that if you're intellectually honest with yourself, you have to recognize how HUMAN BEINGS CREATED GOD in THEIR image, and imbued him with these very \"human\" faults and weaknesses in order to tell an allegorical \"origin story\" -- but it's HARDLY logical. Wouldn't you agree? In any case, I assert that the Christian God is an actual self-cancelling, illogical, contradictory paradox that could not POSSIBLY exist -- because what is claimed about Him is directly contradictory to what we know about actual \"love\", knowledge, omniscience, mercy, good parenting, etc. He's just a chimera of the very worst, and best, of human traits take to illogical extremes. \n\nIn any case, so much of what you're offering as arguments are so inarguably hypothetical and presumptive that, while they make for interesting rumination and coffee-talk, they hardly can have any rock-solid validity as \"evidence\". For example, how do we know that there are not other inhabited planets, other advanced (or even regressive?) species, cultures, civilizations? How would Christianity account for those without some truly convoluted, illogical stretches of imagination? That aside, I would ask you to seriously think about what I pointed out about the illogical proposition of this \"All knowing, All loving, All merciful God\" and really ask yourself if this is a sensible \"God\" to not only believe in, but to slavishly worship?", "2020-06-02T20:27:25Z", "2020-06-02T20:27:25Z"], ["@Connor C Chin Happily I can. First of all, I'm surprised that you would even mention Josephus' work, as if there's any alleged reference to Jesus which has been so thoroughly and almost universally discredited, it's been Jospehus' references. It's almost universally accepted by even Christian Biblical scholars and theologians that the Josephus passages are unambiguous interpolations by later Christians who were eager to \"justify\" their beliefs. I urge you to google the many well-grounded refutations of this particular reference and learn why it is perhaps the most easily-dismissible reference one could cite. Jospehus is NOT a credible reference.\nNext, first let me ask you if you really understand the religious culture back then with regard to Messianic Judiasm? Do you understand what that movement was all about? First, understand that the Roman emperors at that time started an \"Imperial Divinity cult\" where they conferred upon themselves the status of gods, and demanded that \"graven idols\" -- statues, or busts -- of themselves be placed in ALL religious Temples, the Jewish Temple included. Well this was the last straw for the Jews. This is what led them to revolt. The messianic movement was one which anticipated and expected a militaristic \"messiah\" to come and free the Jews from Roman oppression. Accordingly, there were all kinds of self-proclaimed \"messiahs\" ( titled \"Cristos\" or \"Christs\" in the Greek vernacular of the oldest tracts of the Bible we have) running around like modern-day televangelists, performing \"miracles\", making all kinds of claims. So the messianic Jews who were following these \"Christs\" were indeed called \"Christians\". OK? So in all seriousness, when you read about references to \"Christians\" or even a \"Christ\" or \"Cristos\", it's entirely what we would expect to read in GENERIC terms -- it's simply describing a movement, not a SPECIFIC \"Jesus Christ, son of God\". The first \"Christians\" were in fact, messianic Jews. \n\nIt's in this frame of context that you must read so many of these alleged \"references\", Tacitus included. Tacitus never mentions \"Jesus Christ\"; he simply makes a reference to a generic \"Christ\" and \"Christians\". And there are other big problems with Tacitus that cannot be ignored. First, he wrote his stuff a full 25 years after Jesus alleged death, so he is NOT a \"contemporary source\". Second, he called Pilate a \"Procurator\" which is inaccurate; he was in fact a Prefect - something he as a Roman Senator wouldn't have messed up. Tacitus, as a Roman again, would hardly have used the specific religious term \"Cristos\" to describe whoever he was talking about, and furthermore, as Tacitus was the member of a council of priests whose duty it was to supervise foreign religious cults in Rome, he may have only been repeating what he'd heard and learned about the cult of Christians. All in all, there are too many \"reasonable doubt\" stipulations about Tacitus' references to call them authentic. \n\nThe Mara bar Sepion was composed sometime between 73 AD and the 3rd century -- far too vague in its dating to have \"contemporary\" validity. And once again, it doesn't reference \"Jesus Christ\"; it uses an even more ambiguous and contentious title of \"King of the Jews\" which is a decidedly and explicitly ROMAN pejorative used to insult Christians and their claimed messiah. There are other problems with it, but suffice to say that even Christian apologists -- who are always rabidly eager to claim historical authenticity for Jesus --  don't really trumpet this reference as authentic. \nIslam can hardly be considered authentic in any of its mentions as Islam was started 600 years after Christianity and honestly just used contemporary beliefs or references to what had been popular to believe at the time about Christianity's alleged \"Savior\" to \"update the myth\" with a distinctively Middle-Eastern flavor; Islam is basically just a bastardization of Christianity with demographically-familiar actors replacing key Jewish figures; like a play that is re-told with say, Oriental actors/actresses to appeal to that demographic. Islam has no more authenticity than Christianity does. \nIn the Rules of Proof, you can't have this kind of ambiguity and non-contemporary sources whose authenticity and providence cannot be proved with empirical evidence. And as it stands, we have ZERO authentic, contemporary evidence for specifically \"Jesus Christ, son of God\". It just doesn't exist. And I would assert that if we DID, there would be NO other religions, no atheists like me, and no need for \"faith\". It would just be an indisputable historical fact. But it's NOT, obviously, right? And that leads to another very troubling question: since it's NOT, and yet it's supposedly THE MOST important question of all time in Human history, then WHY would a God who allegedly loves and cares so much about us not \"update the files' or send INDISPUTABLE new evidence and just clear it up once and for all? THAT fact alone makes me assert that the God that you believe exists, DOES NOT -- and if he does, such a glaring failure of leadership and authority would certainly disqualify him, in my mind, from ever being something that I could slavishly worship.", "2020-06-02T19:56:12Z", "2020-06-02T19:56:12Z"], ["\u200b@Anthony Davis NOTE: The Big Bang does not contradict the Bible.  The Big Bang is a stable theory, and although there is pushback against it, there is much evidence for it, and it keeps getting bigger.  You said that if I proved that God exists, then you would convert.  OK, here goes:  (Cosmological Argument) 1. The universe is Not Eternal.  Atheists and theists agree that everything which has a beginning has a cause.  Anything that existed forever needs no cause.  This is self-evident, if you think about it.  If something existed forever, then there would be no point in which it did not exist.  If that's the case, there is nothing that proceeds it, therefore there is no cause.  Atheists agree with this, since it is completely logical.  Atheists said that the universe existed forever, and therefore needs no cause.  Us theists said: \"No, GOD has no beginning and therefore no cause.  The universe began to exist.\"  Therefore, the Atheists won until it was discovered that the galaxies were moving away from each other at extremely high speeds, and they were speeding up.  This means the Universe is expanding.  This proved that the Universe was not eternal and began to exist. This means the Universe had a cause.  It was created by an agent.  Let's call it Agent C.  We will be detectives and look for clues.  Agent C must've been powerful enough to create the Universe.  Also, Agent C exists forever without cause.  We're looking for the ULTIMATE creator.  Atheists said it could've been a quantum fluctuation.  We have two options: either it creates one universe then stops.  or, it makes universes on a regular and/or random basis.  There are no other options (only 2) because the quantum fluctuation doesn't have a mind and do something else, in other words, it's  mechanistic.  Let's look at Option 1.  If the fluctuation were to cause one universe, and it's been around for infinite years (has no beginning), then it would be Infinity - whatever years it took to create a Universe.  But since infinity minus anything is infinity, then this would mean that the Universe would've existed forever, which is a contradiction, since the Universe is only 13.7 billion years old.  So, it can be reasonably argued that the Agent C is a personal creator, for how else would a temporal effect arise from an eternal cause?  What about collapsing and expanding universes?  We would be able to measure residual energy left from this were it to happen, but there is none, so science disproves this theory.  Let's look at Option 2: If it took x years to create one universe, and infinite time, then how many universes would there be?  Infinite.  If the time needed to create a universe is not constant, you would still end up with infinite universes.  This also covers loop quantum cosmology, atemporal causality, and all other possibilities.  Also, there is no evidence for multiverse,  because we can't measure them.  But wait, wasn't this the objection that atheists had with God?  This is Blind Faith.  There are other problems, although I won't list them.  There COULD be more than one universe, but infinite universes is impossible.

READING THE BIBLE IS WHAT MADE ME AN ATHEIST!! But I'm really not surprised by both the ignorance and bigotry in your comment because I think that the truth about Homosexuality actually scares you, because it undermines the Bible so completely.. But I'll be happy to educate you out of that. The information IS indeed actually out there; you may have to search for it a bit, but the biological basis for Homosexuality has been known since the 1970s. It was discovered by a man named Dr Gunter Doerner of the University of Humboldt in Berlin in studies that he conducted on both rats and human beings. Based upon research that he had previously done, Doerner hypothesized that the brains of Homosexuals was oriented oppositely from what their phsyical sexual characteristics were. Indeed, he proved this to be true. He found that the casual agent was at least in part due to deficient levels of the hormone testosterone in the host mother at a crucial stage of fetal development when the brain receives its developmental sexual \"orientation\" which then went on to dictate the later-developing physical characteristics of the fetus. Understand, the brain is \"oriented\" BEFORE the sexual organs develop, out of biological necessity. However, if the level of testosterone is deficient in the development of male offspring, then the brain will be mismatched to the LATER sexual development: in short, th Gay males had \"female\" brains. Extending his hypothesis further, Doerner then manipulated the testosterone levels in pregnant rats, and CONSISTENTLY borne male rats which \"mounted\" other male rats as if to mate with them. But the most dramatic confirmation happened when Doerner did an experiment where a control group of both Gay and Straight HUMAN males were injected with a large does of the female hormone estrogen. In a woman, the release of this in a monthly cycle (menstruation) results in a surge of another hormone called \"luteinizing hormone\" (LH) which is responsible for sending a chemical signal to the woman's ovaries to release an egg for possible fertilization. In the results, ONLY THE GAY MALES' BRAINS exhibited this surge of LH hormone -- because they \"expected\" that an ovary would be there to \"receive the signal\". This proved that Doerner was correct in his hypothesis - that true homosexuality is a biological reality dictated by biological mechanisms which could be empirically shown and recorded -- the very basis for Scientific \"proofs\".\nMore recent research has also confirmed this to be true when it was learned that the more male offspring a woman has throughout her life, the higher the odds go that at least one of the latter-born males will, in fact, be Gay, due to the depletion of testosterone as a woman ages. \n\nAnyway, so where's Doerner's research? Well, here's where it went awry. Doerner's research came in the 1970s -- the same time when famed Nazi Hunter Elie Wiesel was hunting down some notorious still-living Nazis like Adolf Eichmann, who used to do live experiments on human subjects in the concentration camps. News of the Holocaust was frequent in the news, as were stories on the atrocities of the Nazis for their various evil programs. When Doerner presented his research, he did so with a conclusion that basically characterized Homosexuality as a biological \"defect\" -- and one that could be \"fixed\" or \"bred out of existence\" by the careful monitoring of pregnant mothers at a certain time frame of pregnancy, and by then augmenting their levels of testosterone if found to be low. I hate to say it, but theoretically -- if not ethically -- he was possibly correct. But it was this presumptuous conclusion that doomed Doerner's research, for it smacked too closely of the Nazi \"Eugenics\" program - the creation of a \"master race\" by selective breeding and exterminations. ANd coming from a GERMAN doctor working out of BERLIN, no less, it set off a firestorm that saw his work quickly disavowed and buried by the academic community, which relied HEAVILY then (as it still does now) on public grants and funding from public sources, and could not possibly stand with such an inflammatory report and conclusion. Even Gay groups at the time understandably decried it, for obvious reasons. \n\nSubsequent studies have only bolstered the biological basis for this fact. A Karolinska INstitute of Sweden study found that the chemical composition of sweat from Gays was actually more similar to the OPPOSITE biological sex than to their own. ANd notable other studies have found clear differences in size in certain brain parts, -- the hypocampus? -- between Gay and Straight people. And as I said, there actually HAS BEEN a genetic link to a greater susceptibility to being homosexually oriented. \nNow, have  you ever read a steamy novel, or maybe a \"Penthouse Forum\" type story and found yourself getting sexually excited by what you were reading? Think about that. Why do you? It's because \"sex\" STARTS IN THE BRAIN. It's not simply a function of your \"parts\", not just a phsyical arousal. It's MENTAL. It's why you have to \"set the mood\" for a woman, and not just grab her genitals and get it on. I feel a bit sorry for you as you obviously hold this ignorant viewpoint because you haven't been availed of this science, but now that you know, to hold onto your self-righteous, judgmental bigotry would just be the height of ignorance.

Statues are being torn down.  State flags are being redesigned and burned.  According to the Democrats, and their Black Lives Matter brethren, all vestiges of the dark time when the Southern States practiced slavery must be stricken from the record. There\u2019s an old saying. Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.  You can\u2019t truly erase history.  Shouldn\u2019t we seek to learn from it.\nThe goal is complete erasure of the sins of the Democrat Party\nIn truth, the leftists\u2019 crusade is not about erasing history as much as it is about erasing the historical sins of the Democrat Party\u2019s past.\n\nThe goal is complete erasure of the sins of the Democrat Party, and the true history of liberty and equality of the Republican Party.  It is the progressive left\u2019s goal to eventually have the mobs convinced that it wasn\u2019t even the Republican Party that was the political party which was created to abolish slavery, in the first place.\n\nGoogle has already begun the effort.  If you Google \u201cWhat political party did Abraham Lincoln belong to,\u201d the answer you will get from Google is \u201cNational Union Party\u201d , not the Republican Party (Abraham Lincoln was the first GOP president).\n\nThe mob reminds me of the Nazis and communists, acting under the cover of darkness seeking to do what they can to erase anything that does not make their ideology look great.  They seek to take down any statues or monuments depicting individuals who were connected to the Confederacy.  It\u2019s like the Muslims wanting to take down the Great Pyramids, and other historical sites, because it\u2019s not Islamic.  Except, there is a difference.  The Democrats don\u2019t want to take down all remnants of  the Confederacy because its not in line with the belief system of their party; they want to take down all remnants of the Confederacy because every last piece of it is a reminder of who the Democrats truly are.  They are the party of slavery.  They are the party of the KKK.  They are the party of Jim Crow Laws.  They are the party of bondage and authoritarianism.  They want their history erased so that they can remake it in a new false image.  A false image they\u2019ve been trying to push since the sixties, but one that only the ill-informed has fallen for.\n\nBondage is through government dependency\nThe pawns, the tools, the idiots who fall for the Democrat Party rhetoric cheer when images of the confederate flag, confederate statues, and confederate monuments are taken down and destroyed.  They cheer, not even realizing that the ones they follow in the Democrat Party are not only the ones connected to slavery in our past, but to bondage in our present ... it\u2019s just that now, the bondage is through government dependency.\n\nIn other words, the Democrat Party Plantation still exists, but instead of the slave-master being a rich southern Democrat plantation owner, the slave-master is now a rich Democrat politician.\n\nIn addition to hiding the Democrat Party\u2019s historical connection to slavery, the cleansing is also a direct attack on the South.  The South used to be solidly Democrat, but now that the once Confederate pro-slavery, pro-Democrat southern States have abandoned the Democrats, the leftists have determined the South must pay the price for their betrayal.\n\nIn the latter part of the twentieth century the southern States began to finally take advantage of manufacturing and production, and as the free market took off in the South, by the late nineties they were ready to start voting Republican (the Southern Strategy/Dixiecrat shift is a myth, by the way) because when it comes to capitalism, it turns out that like the communists, the Democrats hate the free market economy.  So, since the South has become economically prosperous chasing the American Dream, and have abandoned the Democrats, the Democrats have determined the South must be whipped into submission.  What better way to do that then to wipe out any pride Southerners should have in their heritage?  It\u2019s the same strategy as we are seeing at the colleges.  Anything European is being demonized. The left is pushing the \u201cwhite privilege\u201d concoction from their cauldron of steaming racism, and they are using the strategy so as to rewrite history through their own vision of hard left socialist progressive religiosity.\n\nThe snowflakes demand safe spaces and free speech zones\nbecause political correctness dictates that all things not progressive is offensive and hurtful.\n\nThe thing is, it won\u2019t last.  Eventually, liberty will reveal itself to them, and the Democrats will reveal how dark and tyrannical they truly are.\n\nEither that, or true tyranny will take place and anything that disagrees with the Democrats will be silenced, jailed, and eventually executed gestapo-style.\n\nThe Democrats don\u2019t care about the Constitution, or Americanism.  It\u2019s about power, and they are willing to do anything it takes to gain it.\n\nAs for the assault against history, it goes way beyond the confederacy.  It has become identity politics on steroids.  The way to destroy liberty is to destroy the history, especially if the hero in history is a dead white European male. . .\n\nMy buddy John L. Hancock tells a story in his Distortion of History presentation about how the confrontation visited Alfred University way back in 1991.\n\nIn the fall of 1991, the relatively small and quiet university of Alfred University in New York State was engrossed in controversy.  Indignant professors led students in protests, heated debates raged throughout the divided campus, editorials filled the school and local papers. At the heart of the controversy was the newly-installed statue of King Alfred, the medieval English monarch after whom the town and school was named. Ten years prior, when the monument was commissioned, no one could foresee the controversy it would eventually cause. Yet, its placement offended the sensibilities of the university\u2019s history professors.\n\nBy the strong and negative reaction one would think that Alfred must have been a tyrant, an oppressor of his people, a man deserving of the title Alfred the Terrible. Surprisingly, it is the opposite that that is true.\n\nFrom 871 to 899, Alfred was the King of Wessex, one of the four kingdoms that would eventually become England. During his reign he revived the tradition of learning that had died with the fall of the Roman Empire. He required all of his nobles be literate and increased their education by translating the great Latin texts into English. Additionally, he has the honor of being the first king in English history to write a book, preceding King James by eight centuries. Thus, he is known as the \u201ceducation king.\u201d\n\nMore significantly, for the first time, English law would be written and would establish the tradition of England being a land \u2018ruled by laws\u2019 rather than by the whims of powerful men. Within these laws we find the genesis the principles of due process, trial by jury, and respect for the individual; no matter how lowly. His laws protected the commoner from arbitrary and excessive punishment. Even slaves were protected by his laws. There were limits on the number of hours they could be forced to work and were granted 37 work-free holidays per year. Furthermore, the slaves were allowed to work on their own behalf and retain all proceeds from their endeavors. Through the church, Alfred created a system that fed the poor and provided them with medical care.\n\nFor the 9th century, Alfred was a very enlightened king who was loved by his people and for this reason he is the only king in English history to be bestowed the moniker \u201cthe Great.\u201d Alfred the Great, the father of England and education king.\n\nSo why would the history professors be opposed to a memorial to this great proponent of education?\n\nThe truth is that the opposition to Alfred had more to do with what he symbolizes rather than actual history. Linda Mitchell, who specializes in Medieval history, was one of the protesting professors. As she explained in a New York Times interview, Alfred \u201cis not a good logo to promote a modern university because virtually any historical figure who had any social or political influence is undoubtedly going to be a D.W.E.M.\u2014dead white European male,\u201d she said, \u201cit would be foolish to choose a symbol so exclusive and effective in emphasizing the straight white male power structure of history.\u201d\n\nFor Alfred, being a DWEM (Dead White European Male) means that his great achievements are to be ignored because they do not fit into the ideologically-driven, anti-Western civilization, revisionist history that is currently being taught in schools.\n\nSadly, Alfred U is not the only place in academia where the truth is sacrificed to the ideology of leftism.", 0, "2018-08-13T16:41:07Z", "2018-08-13T16:41:07Z"], ["0:50 Even as a resident of Idaho, I still love this guy", 2, "2018-08-13T16:33:59Z", "2018-08-13T16:33:59Z"], ["\"The American people will never knowingly adopt Socialism  But under the name of 'liberalism' they will adopt every fragment of the Socialist  program, until one day America will be a Socialist  nation, without knowing how it happened.\" -- Norman Thomas, Socialist Party Presidential Candidate in 1940, 1944 and 1948, co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union AKA THE ALIEN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION  (ACLU). \u201cI am for socialism, disarmament and ultimately for abolishing the state itself as an instrument of violence and compulsion.

Participants received a nine-point plan to resist established law and turn America into a network of 'freedom cities' that resist the Trump presidential agenda and the vote of the American people in the election of 2016. Uniting with Muslim congressman, Keith Ellison who also called for 'mass rallies' to stop Trump's conservative agenda, the ACLU AKA THE ALIEN CIVIL LIBERTIES hopes to turn America Democratic 'blue' by forcing its liberal Socialistic and Communistic agenda upon all America.\" The ACLU AKA THE ALIEN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION'S leaders and admirers are always claiming that the group exists to protect the individual rights of all Americans, without any political bias; but the claim is disingenuous. In reality the agenda of the ACLU AKA THE ALIEN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION is very similar to that of any other left wing group. On its homepage, the modern day ACLU AKA THE ALIEN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION boasts of \u201c90 YEARS OF PROTECTING YOUR LIBERTY,\u201d but the group\u2019s consistently leftist bent results in some interesting definitions of the term \u201cliberty.\u201d They bring lawsuits to force state governments to give bigger welfare checks to the prolific poor. They call on the federal government to regulate the compensation businesses pay their employees. When malcontent feminists tried to force a privately owned country club to change its admission policies through public protests, media campaigns, and punitive lawsuits targeted at the club\u2019s members, a truly non-partisan civil rights group would have defended the club\u2019s right of association. The ACLU AKA THE ALIEN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION apparently values political correctness over Constitutional rights; they joined the feminists in trying to pressure the club to change its policies. It is easy to understand why college professors and other leftists would admire the ACLU AKA THE ALIEN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION. It stands for all the same values that liberals hold dear.

You stood next to a black person, how tolerant!": [], "The liberal left\u2019s desire to tear down any and all memories of the Confederate States of America is reaching a crescendo.  Statues are being torn down.  State flags are being redesigned and burned.  According to the Democrats, and their Black Lives Matter brethren, all vestiges of the dark time when the Southern States practiced slavery must be stricken from the record. There\u2019s an old saying. Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.  You can\u2019t truly erase history.  Shouldn\u2019t we seek to learn from it.\nThe goal is complete erasure of the sins of the Democrat Party\nIn truth, the leftists\u2019 crusade is not about erasing history as much as it is about erasing the historical sins of the Democrat Party\u2019s past.\n\nThe goal is complete erasure of the sins of the Democrat Party, and the true history of liberty and equality of the Republican Party.  It is the progressive left\u2019s goal to eventually have the mobs convinced that it wasn\u2019t even the Republican Party that was the political party which was created to abolish slavery, in the first place.\n\nGoogle has already begun the effort.  If you Google \u201cWhat political party did Abraham Lincoln belong to,\u201d the answer you will get from Google is \u201cNational Union Party\u201d , not the Republican Party (Abraham Lincoln was the first GOP president).\n\nThe mob reminds me of the Nazis and communists, acting under the cover of darkness seeking to do what they can to erase anything that does not make their ideology look great.  They seek to take down any statues or monuments depicting individuals who were connected to the Confederacy.  It\u2019s like the Muslims wanting to take down the Great Pyramids, and other historical sites, because it\u2019s not Islamic.  Except, there is a difference.  The Democrats don\u2019t want to take down all remnants of  the Confederacy because its not in line with the belief system of their party; they want to take down all remnants of the Confederacy because every last piece of it is a reminder of who the Democrats truly are.  They are the party of slavery.  They are the party of the KKK.  They are the party of Jim Crow Laws.  They are the party of bondage and authoritarianism.  They want their history erased so that they can remake it in a new false image.  A false image they\u2019ve been trying to push since the sixties, but one that only the ill-informed has fallen for.\n\nBondage is through government dependency\nThe pawns, the tools, the idiots who fall for the Democrat Party rhetoric cheer when images of the confederate flag, confederate statues, and confederate monuments are taken down and destroyed.  They cheer, not even realizing that the ones they follow in the Democrat Party are not only the ones connected to slavery in our past, but to bondage in our present ... it\u2019s just that now, the bondage is through government dependency.\n\nIn other words, the Democrat Party Plantation still exists, but instead of the slave-master being a rich southern Democrat plantation owner, the slave-master is now a rich Democrat politician.\n\nIn addition to hiding the Democrat Party\u2019s historical connection to slavery, the cleansing is also a direct attack on the South.  The South used to be solidly Democrat, but now that the once Confederate pro-slavery, pro-Democrat southern States have abandoned the Democrats, the leftists have determined the South must pay the price for their betrayal.\n\nIn the latter part of the twentieth century the southern States began to finally take advantage of manufacturing and production, and as the free market took off in the South, by the late nineties they were ready to start voting Republican (the Southern Strategy/Dixiecrat shift is a myth, by the way) because when it comes to capitalism, it turns out that like the communists, the Democrats hate the free market economy.  So, since the South has become economically prosperous chasing the American Dream, and have abandoned the Democrats, the Democrats have determined the South must be whipped into submission.  What better way to do that then to wipe out any pride Southerners should have in their heritage?  It\u2019s the same strategy as we are seeing at the colleges.  Anything European is being demonized. The left is pushing the \u201cwhite privilege\u201d concoction from their cauldron of steaming racism, and they are using the strategy so as to rewrite history through their own vision of hard left socialist progressive religiosity.\n\nThe snowflakes demand safe spaces and free speech zones\nbecause political correctness dictates that all things not progressive is offensive and hurtful.\n\nThe thing is, it won\u2019t last.  Eventually, liberty will reveal itself to them, and the Democrats will reveal how dark and tyrannical they truly are.\n\nEither that, or true tyranny will take place and anything that disagrees with the Democrats will be silenced, jailed, and eventually executed gestapo-style.\n\nThe Democrats don\u2019t care about the Constitution, or Americanism.  It\u2019s about power, and they are willing to do anything it takes to gain it.\n\nAs for the assault against history, it goes way beyond the confederacy.  It has become identity politics on steroids.  The way to destroy liberty is to destroy the history, especially if the hero in history is a dead white European male. . .\n\nMy buddy John L. Hancock tells a story in his Distortion of History presentation about how the confrontation visited Alfred University way back in 1991.\n\nIn the fall of 1991, the relatively small and quiet university of Alfred University in New York State was engrossed in controversy.  Indignant professors led students in protests, heated debates raged throughout the divided campus, editorials filled the school and local papers. At the heart of the controversy was the newly-installed statue of King Alfred, the medieval English monarch after whom the town and school was named. Ten years prior, when the monument was commissioned, no one could foresee the controversy it would eventually cause. Yet, its placement offended the sensibilities of the university\u2019s history professors.\n\nBy the strong and negative reaction one would think that Alfred must have been a tyrant, an oppressor of his people, a man deserving of the title Alfred the Terrible. Surprisingly, it is the opposite that that is true.\n\nFrom 871 to 899, Alfred was the King of Wessex, one of the four kingdoms that would eventually become England. During his reign he revived the tradition of learning that had died with the fall of the Roman Empire. He required all of his nobles be literate and increased their education by translating the great Latin texts into English. Additionally, he has the honor of being the first king in English history to write a book, preceding King James by eight centuries. Thus, he is known as the \u201ceducation king.\u201d\n\nMore significantly, for the first time, English law would be written and would establish the tradition of England being a land \u2018ruled by laws\u2019 rather than by the whims of powerful men. Within these laws we find the genesis the principles of due process, trial by jury, and respect for the individual; no matter how lowly. His laws protected the commoner from arbitrary and excessive punishment. Even slaves were protected by his laws. There were limits on the number of hours they could be forced to work and were granted 37 work-free holidays per year. Furthermore, the slaves were allowed to work on their own behalf and retain all proceeds from their endeavors. Through the church, Alfred created a system that fed the poor and provided them with medical care.\n\nFor the 9th century, Alfred was a very enlightened king who was loved by his people and for this reason he is the only king in English history to be bestowed the moniker \u201cthe Great.\u201d Alfred the Great, the father of England and education king.\n\nSo why would the history professors be opposed to a memorial to this great proponent of education?\n\nThe truth is that the opposition to Alfred had more to do with what he symbolizes rather than actual history. Linda Mitchell, who specializes in Medieval history, was one of the protesting professors. As she explained in a New York Times interview, Alfred \u201cis not a good logo to promote a modern university because virtually any historical figure who had any social or political influence is undoubtedly going to be a D.W.E.M.\u2014dead white European male,\u201d she said, \u201cit would be foolish to choose a symbol so exclusive and effective in emphasizing the straight white male power structure of history.\u201d\n\nFor Alfred, being a DWEM (Dead White European Male) means that his great achievements are to be ignored because they do not fit into the ideologically-driven, anti-Western civilization, revisionist history that is currently being taught in schools.\n\nSadly, Alfred U is not the only place in academia where the truth is sacrificed to the ideology of leftism.": [["Fake and gay", "2018-08-14T03:02:40Z", "2018-08-14T03:02:40Z"]], "0:50 Even as a resident of Idaho, I still love this guy": [], "\"The American people will never knowingly adopt Socialism  But under the name of 'liberalism' they will adopt every fragment of the Socialist  program, until one day America will be a Socialist  nation, without knowing how it happened.\" -- Norman Thomas, Socialist Party Presidential Candidate in 1940, 1944 and 1948, co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union AKA THE ALIEN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION  (ACLU). \u201cI am for socialism, disarmament and ultimately for abolishing the state itself as an instrument of violence and compulsion. I seek the social ownership of property, the abolition of the propertied class and sole control by those who produce wealth. Communism is, of course, the goal.\u201d ACLU AKA THE ALIEN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION founder Roger Baldwin, 1935 \"In an effort to resist the conservative agenda of President Donald Trump, the ACLU AKA THE ALIEN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION organized everything from mass rallies to weekend house parties, where thousands were reported to have gathered over the weekend. Participants received a nine-point plan to resist established law and turn America into a network of 'freedom cities' that resist the Trump presidential agenda and the vote of the American people in the election of 2016. Uniting with Muslim congressman, Keith Ellison who also called for 'mass rallies' to stop Trump's conservative agenda, the ACLU AKA THE ALIEN CIVIL LIBERTIES hopes to turn America Democratic 'blue' by forcing its liberal Socialistic and Communistic agenda upon all America.\" The ACLU AKA THE ALIEN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION'S leaders and admirers are always claiming that the group exists to protect the individual rights of all Americans, without any political bias; but the claim is disingenuous. In reality the agenda of the ACLU AKA THE ALIEN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION is very similar to that of any other left wing group. On its homepage, the modern day ACLU AKA THE ALIEN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION boasts of \u201c90 YEARS OF PROTECTING YOUR LIBERTY,\u201d but the group\u2019s consistently leftist bent results in some interesting definitions of the term \u201cliberty.\u201d They bring lawsuits to force state governments to give bigger welfare checks to the prolific poor. They call on the federal government to regulate the compensation businesses pay their employees. When malcontent feminists tried to force a privately owned country club to change its admission policies through public protests, media campaigns, and punitive lawsuits targeted at the club\u2019s members, a truly non-partisan civil rights group would have defended the club\u2019s right of association. The ACLU AKA THE ALIEN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION apparently values political correctness over Constitutional rights; they joined the feminists in trying to pressure the club to change its policies. It is easy to understand why college professors and other leftists would admire the ACLU AKA THE ALIEN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION. It stands for all the same values that liberals hold dear.

Not all who were on the confederate side supported it, and unless I'm mixed up, this particular statue was of one of those who did not support slavery anyway. Even if I'm incorrect in this, why does that matter so much? Why take down a piece of history? I don't understand nor support that.\n\nIf there was a rally to defend the statue, I would hesitate to call them White Nationalist or anything like that. They could just be pro-historian. This is why I was skeptical and had to look into things myself. Though, I was troubled to find that yes, *this* rally in particular was led, or at least heavily infested with, white nationalists and bigots. And then was attacked by far left antifa bigots.

How I see it: human evolution started in Africa, and race was the product of migration to different parts of the world. The whole point of melatonin in the skin is to protect the skin from heat. Religion has took advantage of this biological phenomenon to segregate and even enslave people with a darker skintone. Even if Hitler achieved his goal of putting the German people at the peak of humanity, I'm sure that even then human adaptation would still cause melatonin to be added to the skin to protect it from heat. Humans are able to adapt to their environment as much as a rabbit's fur turns white in the winter for camouflage to attack prey easily. Germans however would still continue to have light skin if they remained in the north however because of how global warming goes \"in and out\" which is why the topic of global warming is denied. The Earth continues to get hotter, and it has been proven that in the future there will be less \"white\" people and more dark skinned people. I hear Nazis say things like \"we are losing our white people\" but to me this makes no sense because we are not necessarily losing any race, for we are constantly breeding with other races and evolving to protect ourselves for the heat. On a side note, having more melatonin in the skin is actually healthier, meaning light skin is an imperfection opposed to how people treat dark skinned people. People need to stop referring to groups of people with a different skin tone as \"They\" or \"Asians\" or \"Blacks\" or \"Whites\" or \"Hispanics\" instead referring to their nationality, or their ethnic group, or their cultural background, or their descent. Let alone that by automatically judging or categorizing someone by skin tone, is actually incorrect in most cases since more and more people are Multiracial or Mixed raced. If you go even farther, you will be able to see that we are not only human, but organic, no different from any other organism from a entirely different planet for that matter. There is no race, there are species, and all humans have biological traits that are derived from other species. It is also incorrect to assume that other species aren\u2019t nearly as intelligent as humans are because even small fish and insects are able to feel human-like emotion to a certain extent, and animals have human like features, which clearly shows that humans are a product of organisms adapting to their environment to be more biologically advanced so they can be higher up on the food chain. This even applies to plants as well, so when per say, a human who only eats meat, is not ethically wrong, but slows the advancement of human survival dependent on the population of the food chain to be maintained. Eating only plants is not an issue since it solves the issue of animals being mistreated and for their absence to affect the environment negatively and disrupt the food chain. Even methane released from farm animal\u2019s has been proven to be one of the greatest factors of global warming. However, it is wrong to take away plant's lives to make room for human living space, since it takes away the ecosystem from animals, disrupting the food chain. Because of how most people are taught, it is easy and empowering to ignore the truth by clouding your mind with religious morals. Even authority uses religion to manipulate people's minds and behavior controls the direction of society right from the roots of education. North Korea for example, has shut out all of society so that authority has the power to educate them about how America is the enemy, or the leader should be worshiped as a god by fear of the consequences. While we are arguing about the ethics of things like this, we never address the idea that the universe doesn't care if our species lives or dies. We are but stardust thrown onto this planet, governed by laws society created, and educated of right and wrong. While there are consequences to our actions, there are no laws from a universal perspective. It is wrong to kill or murder someone per say according to our laws, but that appeals to the goal of the human species to survive. Though education has been a major factor in slowing the progress of the human species because of the economic benefits of authority. Because light skinned people have mistreated dark skinned people, there has been a lack of trust and forgiveness, leading to dark skinned community\u2019s to terrorize light skinned communities, causing light skinned communities to get their revenge. This race war has lasted since the beginning of religion, or rather a war against our own species, a war in which we don't know what side where on. Both light and dark skinned people are fighting for their rights, privileges, and pride, while terrorizing the other skin tone for their opposing beliefs will not make any progress. If the goal is peace among our species, for our communities, then all skin tones of humans should be recognized and treated as humans, to show equality and acceptance, to welcome all skin tones into one community. Limiting praise to only one skin tone for example: \u201cblack lives matter,\u201d or \u201cwhite lives matter,\u201d only accentuates the issue by causing a praise or popularity war on which skin tone should or shouldn\u2019t be mistreated more or less according to how much the skin tone has been mistreated in the past. For example: \u201c I am a \u201cblack\u201d person, many \u201cblack\u201d people were enslaved and segregated by \u201cwhite\u201d people in the past, therefore, \u201cblack\u201d people should have the incentive to mistreats \u201cwhites\u201d for revenge.\u201d No, because mistreating \u201cwhites\u201d would only prove to them that you and the \u201cblack\u201d community you represent deserve to be mistreated for mistreating their \u201cwhite\u201d community. People that commit crimes, like plowing through a group of protesters, should not be recognized by the skin tone they represent or their political stance, but by the ethical laws that they have broken. People deserve to have their own political opinions, but being clouded by religious-driven supremacism will only keep you and your community to be looked down upon and terrorized for that matter, for it is not a law that pertains to human progress. Even non religious people can be influenced simply by the conformity of racism. Neutral, non-religious people are not necessarily forcing you to change your beliefs, terrorizing a person just because of their skin tone however is ethically wrong to someone who treats all people equally. People that are religious should not be mistreated for the same reasons, just because they are of a certain religion, but people do not deserve to be terrorized because of the manipulation of religion. 9/11 was the result of religion being manipulated to undergo terrorism, but this doesn\u2019t mean all people of that religion should be represented by terrorists, for it\u2019s not the terrorist\u2019s fault that they were educated to disrupt human morality.

No. The reason we name universities, monuments, battle implements, forts, etc. after these men is because they were skilled and effective _American commanders_ who performed mostly well considering what they had to contend with and what resources were at their disposal; they also fought for what they believed in to the utmost of their ability, what many Dixie folks considered the safety and self-governing of their homeland. In particular with Lee, (a pious man who _opposed_ the concepts of both slavery and secession) it was his home he believed was worth fighting for as he apparently couldn't bear the thought of willingly invading it at the head of a federal army mobilized solely to subdue and kill these \"traitors\", many of whom he probably knew.

How I see it: human evolution started in Africa, and race was the product of migration to different parts of the world. The whole point of melatonin in the skin is to protect the skin from heat. Religion has took advantage of this biological phenomenon to segregate and even enslave people with a darker skintone. Even if Hitler achieved his goal of putting the German people at the peak of humanity, I'm sure that even then human adaptation would still cause melatonin to be added to the skin to protect it from heat. Humans are able to adapt to their environment as much as a rabbit's fur turns white in the winter for camouflage to attack prey easily. Germans however would still continue to have light skin if they remained in the north however because of how global warming goes \"in and out\" which is why the topic of global warming is denied. The Earth continues to get hotter, and it has been proven that in the future there will be less \"white\" people and more dark skinned people. I hear Nazis say things like \"we are losing our white people\" but to me this makes no sense because we are not necessarily losing any race, for we are constantly breeding with other races and evolving to protect ourselves for the heat. On a side note, having more melatonin in the skin is actually healthier, meaning light skin is an imperfection opposed to how people treat dark skinned people. People need to stop referring to groups of people with a different skin tone as \"They\" or \"Asians\" or \"Blacks\" or \"Whites\" or \"Hispanics\" instead referring to their nationality, or their ethnic group, or their cultural background, or their descent. Let alone that by automatically judging or categorizing someone by skin tone, is actually incorrect in most cases since more and more people are Multiracial or Mixed raced. If you go even farther, you will be able to see that we are not only human, but organic, no different from any other organism from a entirely different planet for that matter. There is no race, there are species, and all humans have biological traits that are derived from other species. It is also incorrect to assume that other species aren\u2019t nearly as intelligent as humans are because even small fish and insects are able to feel human-like emotion to a certain extent, and animals have human like features, which clearly shows that humans are a product of organisms adapting to their environment to be more biologically advanced so they can be higher up on the food chain. This even applies to plants as well, so when per say, a human who only eats meat, is not ethically wrong, but slows the advancement of human survival dependent on the population of the food chain to be maintained. Eating only plants is not an issue since it solves the issue of animals being mistreated and for their absence to affect the environment negatively and disrupt the food chain. Even methane released from farm animal\u2019s has been proven to be one of the greatest factors of global warming. However, it is wrong to take away plant's lives to make room for human living space, since it takes away the ecosystem from animals, disrupting the food chain. Because of how most people are taught, it is easy and empowering to ignore the truth by clouding your mind with religious morals. Even authority uses religion to manipulate people's minds and behavior controls the direction of society right from the roots of education. North Korea for example, has shut out all of society so that authority has the power to educate them about how America is the enemy, or the leader should be worshiped as a god by fear of the consequences. While we are arguing about the ethics of things like this, we never address the idea that the universe doesn't care if our species lives or dies. We are but stardust thrown onto this planet, governed by laws society created, and educated of right and wrong. While there are consequences to our actions, there are no laws from a universal perspective. It is wrong to kill or murder someone per say according to our laws, but that appeals to the goal of the human species to survive. Though education has been a major factor in slowing the progress of the human species because of the economic benefits of authority. Because light skinned people have mistreated dark skinned people, there has been a lack of trust and forgiveness, leading to dark skinned community\u2019s to terrorize light skinned communities, causing light skinned communities to get their revenge. This race war has lasted since the beginning of religion, or rather a war against our own species, a war in which we don't know what side where on. Both light and dark skinned people are fighting for their rights, privileges, and pride, while terrorizing the other skin tone for their opposing beliefs will not make any progress. If the goal is peace among our species, for our communities, then all skin tones of humans should be recognized and treated as humans, to show equality and acceptance, to welcome all skin tones into one community. Limiting praise to only one skin tone for example: \u201cblack lives matter,\u201d or \u201cwhite lives matter,\u201d only accentuates the issue by causing a praise or popularity war on which skin tone should or shouldn\u2019t be mistreated more or less according to how much the skin tone has been mistreated in the past. For example: \u201c I am a \u201cblack\u201d person, many \u201cblack\u201d people were enslaved and segregated by \u201cwhite\u201d people in the past, therefore, \u201cblack\u201d people should have the incentive to mistreats \u201cwhites\u201d for revenge.\u201d No, because mistreating \u201cwhites\u201d would only prove to them that you and the \u201cblack\u201d community you represent deserve to be mistreated for mistreating their \u201cwhite\u201d community. People that commit crimes, like plowing through a group of protesters, should not be recognized by the skin tone they represent or their political stance, but by the ethical laws that they have broken. People deserve to have their own political opinions, but being clouded by religious-driven supremacism will only keep you and your community to be looked down upon and terrorized for that matter, for it is not a law that pertains to human progress. Even non religious people can be influenced simply by the conformity of racism. Neutral, non-religious people are not necessarily forcing you to change your beliefs, terrorizing a person just because of their skin tone however is ethically wrong to someone who treats all people equally. People that are religious should not be mistreated for the same reasons, just because they are of a certain religion, but people do not deserve to be terrorized because of the manipulation of religion. 9/11 was the result of religion being manipulated to undergo terrorism, but this doesn\u2019t mean all people of that religion should be represented by terrorists, for it\u2019s not the terrorist\u2019s fault that they were educated to disrupt human morality.
