Sater was at Trump's election victory party.\n\n- Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was at the Trump Tower meeting.

You can read EU and IMF documents.\nUS did not fund the Ukrainian revolution, you do not know how to understand world politics.\nClintons have nothing to do with Russian gas or oil pipelines, read Hillary and Billy's tax returns.\n\nYou claim to have studied a lot.  Hard to believe because in that case you lack the skill of reading comprehension.  Apparently you admire Putin, as does Trump.  Neither of you has apparently ever been acquainted with his personal history, and by the way, you do not understand the Russian way of thinking, nor Putin at all.  Will I repeat the advice given by our President to Trump on how to deal with Putin?  They can be found in Bolton's book, but we knew about it right after the Putin / Trump Helsinki meeting.  Needless to say, Trump can\u2019t listen to advice, let alone follow it.\nWould it be time for you to retire to study or play so that adults can chat in peace. It is tiring to try to teach a mentally immature person the facts of life.\n\nHere is part of Iltalehti's article on June 22, 2020. \n\n Bolton tells how the President of the Republic Sauli Niinist\u00f6 advised Trump on the treatment of Russian President Vladimir Putin. When the presidents met in M\u00e4ntyniemi, Niinist\u00f6 had presented Trump with three points about working with Russia.\n\n First, he dealt with Putin and his encounter.  According to Niinist\u00f6, Putin is a fighter whose every attack Trump would have to respond by striking back.\n\n As another matter, Niinist\u00f6 emphasized that by showing respect to Putin, it is possible to create a more confident relationship, in which case he may be more tactful.\n\n Niinist\u00f6\u2019s third point came as if from the boxing coach\u2019s mouth, as Bolton described, when he told Trump that Putin should not be allowed to strike a single hole, nor give up an inch.\n\n Niinist\u00f6 decided to rip Trump, saying that \u201cthe Cossack will take what is loosely attached\u201d.\n\n  At that time, the presidents also discussed Finland's national defense status.  Niinist\u00f6 had reminded Trump of the strength of the Finnish Defense Forces' war of 280,000 people during the war, and that attacking Finland would be costly for the attacker. Trump had asked if Finland wanted to join NATO.  Niinist\u00f6 gave a complicated answer, and did not say yes or no, but left the door open for possible accession.  Niinist\u00f6 said Putin is not stupid and would not attack NATO country.\n\n Niinist\u00f6 did not believe that Putin would return the Crimean peninsula he had taken over from Ukraine.\n\n\"One instructive Russian proverb is: 'Kazak berjot shto ploho leshit', or 'the Cossack takes what is loose.'\"\n\nHere is an excerpt from the article from year 2014.\n\n - Kazak berjot shto ploho leshit?  The Cossacks lived mostly in Ukraine.  That means the Cossack takes what is out of control.  If you leave something somewhere and you don\u2019t take care of it, then the passing Cossack will come and take it for himself.  It can be a horse, a car or even a trunk.  Things have to be taken care of, otherwise the Cossack will come and take it, Pushkov explains.\n\n - The Cossacks originally consisted of people who fled Russia in the 15th and 15th centuries and ended up in Ukraine.  They were land slaves who fled their masters in Russia.  They were basically free people, but some of them formed gangs of bandits along the way.  Why else do you ask this?\n\n - I ask because yesterday our President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 used this phrase and added that it is worth listening to this household doctrine, you have to take care of your things and goods and if you do not, all sorts of things can happen.\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2019/12/16/788597848/u-s-aid-to-ukrainep-is-mostly-military-not-cash\n\nhttps://money.cnn.com/2016/08/12/pf/taxes/hillary-clinton-tax-return/index.html\n\nhttps://www.taxnotes.com/presidential-tax-returns", "2020-06-30T12:52:43Z", "2020-06-30T12:52:43Z"], ["@BARTETMEDIA Cool conspiracy theory bro", "2020-06-30T05:48:11Z", "2020-06-30T05:48:11Z"], ["@Carlos Duque Don't read that.

After the meeting, our magazines reported that our president had told Trump how to deal with Putin. The advice would seem (once again) to echo \"deaf ears.\"\nHere is part of Iltalehti's article on June 22, 2020.\n\nBolton tells how the President of the Republic Sauli Niinist\u00f6 advised Trump on the treatment of Russian President Vladimir Putin. When the presidents met in M\u00e4ntyniemi, Niinist\u00f6 had presented Trump with three points about working with Russia.\n\n First, he dealt with Putin and his encounter.  According to Niinist\u00f6, Putin is a fighter whose every attack Trump would have to respond by striking back.\n\n As another matter, Niinist\u00f6 emphasized that by showing respect to Putin, it is possible to create a more confident relationship, in which case he may be more tactful.\n\n Niinist\u00f6\u2019s third point came as if from the boxing coach\u2019s mouth, as Bolton described, when he told Trump that Putin should not be allowed to strike a single hole, nor give up an inch.\n\n Niinist\u00f6 decided to rip Trump, saying that \u201cthe Cossack will take what is loosely attached\u201d.\n\n At that time, the presidents also discussed Finland's national defense status.  Niinist\u00f6 had reminded Trump of the strength of the Finnish Defense Forces' war of 280,000 people during the war, and that attacking Finland would be costly for the attacker. Trump had asked if Finland wanted to join NATO.  Niinist\u00f6 gave a complicated answer, and did not say yes or no, but left the door open for possible accession.  Niinist\u00f6 said Putin is not stupid and would not attack NATO country.\n\n \"Niinist\u00f6 did not believe that Putin would return the Crimean peninsula he had taken over from Ukraine.\"\n---\nHere is an article from 2014 explaining the background of that Cossack saying.\n--\n\"One instructive Russian proverb is:\" Kazak berjot shto ploho leshit \"or\" Cossack takes what is loose.\"\nUndoubtedly, this doctrine of household maintenance based on experience is worth listening to.  We have to take care of things, we have to hold on.  If you don\u2019t, it can start to happen. \u201d\n\n This is what President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 said at the opening of the national defense course on Monday. The comment caused confusion in Finland, and Niinist\u00f6 refused to explain in more detail whether the comment was related to the situation in Ukraine, the annexation of Crimea to Russia or what.\n\n We asked Alexei Pushkov, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Russian Duma, who is visiting Finland, if the proverb is familiar.\n\n - Kazak berjot shto ploho leshit?  The Cossacks lived mostly in Ukraine. That means the Cossack takes what is out of control.  If you leave something somewhere and you don\u2019t take care of it, then the passing Cossack will come and take it for himself.  It can be a horse, a car or even a trunk. Things have to be taken care of, otherwise the Cossack will come and take it, Pushkov explains.\n\n - The Cossacks originally consisted of people who fled Russia in the 15th and 15th centuries and ended up in Ukraine.  They were land slaves who fled their masters in Russia.  They were basically free people, but some of them formed gangs of bandits along the way.  Why else do you ask this?\n\n - I ask because yesterday our President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 used this phrase and added that it is worth listening to this household doctrine, you have to take care of your things and goods and if you do not, all sorts of things can happen.\n---\nDoes anyone think Trump will succeed in international politics or that he will be able to do anything sensible in your domestic politics?  He has no idea of \u200b\u200bhistory, cultures, politics, or diplomacy, he doesn\u2019t even understand your constitution, nor the structure and functions of government.  He, and apparently many others, have the notion that the state can be run in the same way as a private company.  You have a lot of childlike citizens and even politicians, otherwise he would not have been elected.  Trump\u2019s entire career has been based on, inherited from the father, donations from the father, borrowing, tax evasion, and cheating on business partners, contractors, and employees.  He sees the state and political opponents in the same way as his company.  Would it be your time to define some kind of minimum requirements for the level of education of a presidential candidate.  There is no need to have a university degree if you have knowledge of world history, knowledge and experience of the state and laws. In addition, the president is required to have the ability to ask and listen, to be admitted if one does not know or understand something.

Its pretty much geopolitics.  IMHO the Cold War is an ongoing conflict since the Rome was split into Western Romans and Byzantine Empire.  Russia was influenced by Byzantine Greeks and adopted their type of Empirical government after Tatars and Mongols were eradicated (look at the double-headed Eagle on the Russia's flag).  Western Rome became France, England, Germany, etc, and Poland stuck in between. Historically Western Europe was with conflict with Russia and the US is the New World Western Europe.

This is a joke right ? \r\nThe so praised Obama did nothing at all when ISIL attacked the military base in Iraq with 500 men and stole $ 3 billion in military equipment. The military left the base to the terrorists without a fight because the commanders became afraid and simply left the base. In the Vice News documentary, the Kurds insulted them as cowards. The reporters were  live on site and documented this incident. With the captured war equipment ISIL attacked the central bank , took control of the oil fields, changed its name to ISIS, recruited many new members and took over entire cities. Mr. Obama did nothing. Not really a Nobel Peace Prize  worthy policy . Perhaps that prize was the reason to do nothing.  A politics of chaos that some politicians simply accepted. The oil was smuggled across the border into Turkey and sold to world markets for a fraction of the money.\r\nFor months, politicians asked Mr. Obama to do something about it, but nothing happened. Nothing happened until it was too late and the terrorists made billions of dollars from oil smuggling.\r\nNow on the subject of Libya. Mr. Gaddafi was invited everywhere and the man was promised economic aid if he disarmes his military. Disarmament treaties and immigration agreements have been signed with the EU. Libya was our external border. After the man complied with the contracts, curbed immigration and disarmed his military, a no-fly zone was imposed, and the man, according to Mr. Peter Scholl-Latour, who received a lot of material, was impaled, in  the name of democracy,   on an iron bar . Here is a video in which Peter Scholl-Latour spoke about the circumstances of Mr. Gaddafi's death and the effects of an intervention in Libya https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcRewTT2n68\r\nThis destroyed the entire trust of the Muslim world in the West.

A reform that allows criminal proceedings to be resumed and checked for correctness, if inmates have concerns that there may have been an incorrect judgment based on  indications, or if they think it it possibly was a  a racially motivated judgment before in the worst case a death sentence can be carried out.\r\nMr. Trump signed this act. A reform that benefited the black population. Many black people were released, after it was found out that they were innocently imprisoned.\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Step_Act\r\nI asked some black people from problem areas on the Internet what they think of Mr. Trump's immigration policy. The answer was as follows. A country must ensure that it can provide enough resources in the form of jobs for the black population. Here in Compton, someone used to be shot out of the car every day. Our district benefits from camera surveillance and a limitation of immigration.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump signed the \"Music Modernization Act\". A law that benefited the black population because they now get money from advertising revenue when their music is played on streams and on the Internet.\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Modernization_Act\r\nThen there was Mr. Trump's support for school choice. A free choice of the school, which is not tied to its district and which benefits the black population.\r\nDemocrats like Joe Biden don't like this idea at all!

Today a human child slave, which was previously kidnapped or sold and transported ti another country costs only $ 200.

The accuracy of other Institutes fluctuated in the double-digit range. These show that Mr Trump have a 40 percent approval rate among the black population. Why is that ? This is exactly explained in this video.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZw4pNdWXpc&frags=pl%2Cwn\r\nThe Video is about people of color expressing how happy they are, that the unemployment rate among African Americans was at the lowest level, before Corona.\r\nIt was about the First Speb act. A reform that allows criminal proceedings to be resumed and checked for correctness, if inmates have concerns that there may have been an incorrect judgment based on  indications, or if they think it it possibly was a  a racially motivated judgment before in the worst case a death sentence can be carried out.\r\nMr. Trump signed this act. A reform that benefited the black population. Many black people were released, after it was found out that they were innocently imprisoned.\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Step_Act\r\nI asked some black people from problem areas on the Internet what they think of Mr. Trump's immigration policy. The answer was as follows. A country must ensure that it can provide enough resources in the form of jobs for the black population. Here in Compton, someone used to be shot out of the car every day. Our district benefits from camera surveillance and a limitation of immigration.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump signed the \"Music Modernization Act\". A law that benefited the black population because they now get money from advertising revenue when their music is played on streams and on the Internet.\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Modernization_Act\r\nThen there was Mr. Trump's support for school choice. A free choice of the school, which is not tied to its district and which benefits the black population.\r\nDemocrats like Joe Biden don't like this idea at all! They not want there children to be in the same school with a black person. \r\nMr. Trump pardoned Ms. Alice Johnson. A black woman sentenced to life imprisonment for a single violation of the Narcotics Act and and never committed a crime before\r\nAs I see it, not a single law has been signed that would have harmed the black population in any way.\r\nMelania Trump spoke about how Africa should be helped through fair economic contracts so that one day they can establish child benefit and child benefit ceilings.\r\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4RQYKi-2d8&t=2s\r\nMr. Trump signed the ending human trafficing and modern slavery act.\r\nThe effort has been spearheaded in large part by Ivanka Trump, the President's daughter and top adviser, who has made human trafficking one of her initiatives.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFDC34RurY\r\nI sent the woman a lot of documentation about the slave trade in the past, and the new slave routes, and slavery is still a problem in many countries. A slave used to cost up to $ 2,000 during the time of the US and british Slavetrade. That's why those people were given medical care in the past. Today the situation is many times worse. Today a human child slave, which was previously kidnapped or sold and transported ti another country costs only $ 200.

These US planes Russia acquired included three B-52 bombers. The US figured the Russians wouldn't be able to crew or fly the B-52 bombers, yet the Soviets  piloted and fully displayed the 3 American B-52's they had acquired, flying them past a shocked General Eisenhower who was attending the Soviet military parade, but then the 3 Soviet piloted American B-52's were followed in the parades proccession by 500 reverse engineered B-52 Russian bombers, flown past the American contingents for effect, in effect setting off the cold war.

By the wars end more than $20 billion in U.S. funds were funnelled through Pakistan. Controversially $600 million went to Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami party which had the dubious distinction of never winning a significant battle during the war. They also killed significant numbers of mujahideen from other parties, and eventually took a virulently anti-Western line. Cyclone nevertheless was one of the CIA's longest and most expensive covert operations. The full significance of the U.S. sending aid to the mujahideen prior to the intervention is debated among scholars. Some assert that it directly, and even deliberately, provoked the Soviets to send in troops. According to Steve Coll's dissenting analysis, however: \"Contemporary memos\u2014particularly those written in the first days after the Soviet invasion\u2014make clear that while Brzezinski was determined to confront the Soviets in Afghanistan through covert action, he was also very worried the Soviets would prevail. ... Given this evidence and the enormous political and security costs that the invasion imposed on the Carter administration, any claim that Brzezinski lured the Soviets into Afghanistan warrants deep skepticism.\"\n\nAs a consequence the US launched attempted to buy back the Stinger missiles, with a $55 million program launched in 1990 to buy back around 300 missiles (US$183,300 each).[...]\"\n\nMust be funny as a US soldier to know their own government paid and trained almost all foreign militias that they themselves then go and fight decades after, because the original plan to destabalize a region or fight a proxy war was a desaster.

Mueller III indicted 13 Russian individuals and three Russian organizations for engaging in operations to interfere with U.S. political and electoral processes, including the 2016 presidential election. This was a significant step forward in exposing a surreptitious social media campaign and holding accountable those responsible for this attack. The indictment spells out in exhaustive detail the breadth and systematic nature of this conspiracy, dating back to 2014, as well as the multiple ways in which Russian actors misused online platforms to carry out their clandestine operations.\n\nThroughout the indictment, Mueller lays out important facts about the activities of the Internet Research Agency (IRA)\u2014the notorious Russian \u201ctroll\u201d farm\u2014and its operatives:\n\n\u201cDefendants, posing as U.S. persons and creating false U.S. personas, operated social media pages and groups designed to attract U.S. audiences. These groups and pages, which addressed divisive U.S. political and social issues, falsely claimed to be controlled by U.S. activists when, in fact, they were controlled by Defendants. Defendants also used the stolen identities of real U.S. persons to post on ORGANIZATION-controlled social media accounts. Over time, these social media accounts became Defendants\u2019 means to reach significant numbers of Americans for purposes of interfering with the U.S. political system, including the presidential election of 2016.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe indictment also notes that the IRA:\n\n\u201c[H]ad a strategic goal to sow discord in the U.S. political system, including the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Defendants posted derogatory information about a number of candidates, and by early to mid-2016, Defendants\u2019 operations included supporting the presidential campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump (\u201cTrump Campaign\u201d) and disparaging Hillary Clinton. Defendants made various expenditures to carry out those activities, including buying political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities. Defendants also staged political rallies inside the United States, and while posing as U.S. grassroots entities and U.S. persons, and without revealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation, solicited and compensated real U.S. persons to promote or disparage candidates. Some Defendants, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities.\u201d\n\nSource https://intelligence.house.gov/social-media-content/", "2020-08-26T09:04:17Z", "2020-08-26T09:04:17Z"], ["https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/top-general-doubts-russian-bounty-program-killed-us/story?id=7165387", "2020-08-08T15:50:32Z", "2020-08-08T15:50:32Z"], ["https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-russian-bounties-briefing-cia-officials-decided-against", "2020-08-08T15:50:08Z", "2020-08-08T15:50:08Z"], ["https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/top-general-doubts-russian-bounty-program-killed-us/story?id=71653874", "2020-08-08T15:48:24Z", "2020-08-08T15:48:24Z"], ["@Granodiorite 3 unkown NATO officials?.. sounds like 3 flying pigs..\n\nLets read what U.S. Marine Corps Gen.

By the wars end more than $20 billion in U.S. funds were funnelled through Pakistan. Controversially $600 million went to Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami party which had the dubious distinction of never winning a significant battle during the war. They also killed significant numbers of mujahideen from other parties, and eventually took a virulently anti-Western line. Cyclone nevertheless was one of the CIA's longest and most expensive covert operations. The full significance of the U.S. sending aid to the mujahideen prior to the intervention is debated among scholars. Some assert that it directly, and even deliberately, provoked the Soviets to send in troops. According to Steve Coll's dissenting analysis, however: \"Contemporary memos\u2014particularly those written in the first days after the Soviet invasion\u2014make clear that while Brzezinski was determined to confront the Soviets in Afghanistan through covert action, he was also very worried the Soviets would prevail. ... Given this evidence and the enormous political and security costs that the invasion imposed on the Carter administration, any claim that Brzezinski lured the Soviets into Afghanistan warrants deep skepticism.\"\n\nAs a consequence the US launched attempted to buy back the Stinger missiles, with a $55 million program launched in 1990 to buy back around 300 missiles (US$183,300 each).[...]\"\n\nMust be funny as a US soldier to know their own government paid and trained almost all foreign militias that they themselves then go and fight decades after, because the original plan to destabalize a region or fight a proxy war was a desaster.

In April 2016, one of the Baltic states shared with then\u2013CIA director John Brennan an audio recording of Russians discussing funneling money to the Trump campaign. In the summer of 2016, Robert Hannigan, head of the U.K. intelligence agency GCHQ, flew to Washington to brief Brennan on intercepted communications between the Trump campaign and Russia..\r\n\r\nThe contents of these communications have not been disclosed, but what Brennan learned obviously unsettled him profoundly. In congressional testimony on Russian election interference, Brennan hinted that some Americans might have betrayed their country. \u201cIndividuals who go along a treasonous path,\u201d he warned, \u201cdo not even realize they\u2019re along that path until it gets to be a bit too late.\u201d In a 2017 interview, he put it more bluntly: \u201cI think Trump is afraid of the president of Russia. The Russians may have something on him personally that they could always roll out and make his life more difficult.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn July 2016, a loose-knit community of computer scientists and cybersecurity experts discovered a strange pattern of online traffic between two computer servers. One of those servers belonged to Alfa Bank in Moscow and the other to the Trump Organization. Alfa Bank\u2019s owners had \u201cassumed an unforeseen level of prominence and influence in the economic and political affairs of their nation,\u201d as a federal court once put it.\r\n\r\nThe analysts noted that the traffic between the two servers occurred during office hours in New York and Moscow and spiked in correspondence with major campaign events, suggesting it entailed human communication rather than bots. More suspiciously, after New York Times reporter Eric Lichtblau asked Alfa Bank about it but before he brought it up with the Trump campaign, the server in Trump Tower shut down. The timing strongly implied Alfa Bank was communicating with Trump.\r\n\r\nTrump knows, that Brennan knows, he's a compromised Russian asset.\r\n\r\nOne big unanswered question is why were Trump and his people having so many interactions with Russian officials and Russian operatives during the campaign? They were having more interactions with Russians than Americans.\r\n\r\nOn April 18, 2019, a redacted copy of Mueller\u2019s report was released to the public. The Mueller report builds on the U.S. intelligence conclusion that there were two campaigns to elect Trump\u2014 one run by Trump and one run by the Russian government. The Mueller report clearly identified connections between the Trump campaign and Russia...\r\n\r\nA total of 272 contacts between Trump\u2019s team and Russia-linked operatives were identified, including at least 38 meetings. We now know that at least 33 high-ranking campaign officials and Trump advisers had or were at least aware of contacts with Russia-linked operatives during the campaign and transition, including Trump himself, Don Jr, Manafort, Flynn, Jared, Papadopoulos,  Rick Gates, and Roger Stone, just to name a few. But what's worse, is the fact that they all lied about these contacts. None of these contacts were ever reported to the proper authorities. Instead, the Trump team tried to cover them up, every single one of them.\r\n\r\nThe question every American should be asking is why were there so many contacts(272) between Trump\u2019s people and Russian officials and operatives, and why did Trump and his people lie about those contacts?", "2020-06-28T16:14:05Z", "2020-06-28T16:14:05Z"], ["@immobilien Its unsettling how few people remember events from less than 5 years ago.", "2020-06-28T14:57:45Z", "2020-06-28T14:57:45Z"], ["@WrizzleDVM  The left have to know how dumb they sound.

I would tell you about what you do not know. The fact is that in relation to most countries of the world (including Russia), the rule applies, all bank transfers between countries with a buffer go through American banks. That is, U.S. intelligence is really able to track transfers and block them (which they regularly use). For example, in 2014, when people from mainland Russia sent bank transfers to their relatives in annexed Crimea (to Ukrainian banks, which at the time of 2014 were still working), they ran into a problem, money was blocked on some transfer accounts in American banks. As soon as sanctions were imposed on Russia, all banks received orders from the United States to ban banking operations on the Crimean peninsula. Now think about why, after so many years of war between NATO and the Taliban, the United States has still not issued such instructions and people from the Taliban can still receive such bank transfers. Either there were no bank transfers, or they were, but someone did this \"friendly\" to this system.\nThis is true information, check it.

Moscow Mitch kept President Obama from filling the 100 or so judgeships he should have been able to fill as the President of the United States. He held those positions for the next president to fill. HOW DID MOSCOW MITCH KNOW TO keep those positions for the next president to fill ??  HOW  DID  HE  KNOW  TRUMP  WAS  GOING  TO  WIN  THE  ELECTION ??\nTrump was clueless who put in those positions, Moscow Mitch is the one who filled them. He\u2019s has never stopped. Stacking the courts with  unqualified people who would do whatever Moscow Mitch or trump  TELLS  THEM  TO  DO.  \nTHE  PRIME  EXAMPLE  IS KAVACREEP.  No doubt they knew all about Kavacreep and knew he would be a trump stooge. One can only imagine what kind of people have been appointed to the other judgeships. WHY has trump never stopped talking about the 2016 election ? Now he is nonstop complaining about the 2020 election being rigged, when republicans have taken THOUSANDS of voters off voting registers. Closing places for people to vote. Trump has launched his campaign on how fraudulent, mail in voting will be, while he mails in his vote. \nWHY  was trump so willing to shut down the United States Post Office ??  Could it be that the republicans, with the aid of Putin,  AGAIN, mail in voting will be harder for them to  CHEAT  and interfere with ??\nPutin said, from his own mouth, he interfered in the 2016 election and planned to do the same in 2020.

Very few have responded like you have.  Until last week, I had one remaining great-aunt on my mom's side of the family.  She was 97.  The virus killed her.  The virus didn't care that she'd been a very nice, friendly, smart human being for most of her life.  The virus didn't care that I enjoyed visiting her trailer park in California in 1974 (when I was 7 years old).  I will miss her.  Very much.  She was much more like one of us \"kids\" rather than one of the adults.  She made things fun, even on hot, dry days.  I can see her face and hear her voice right now.  Heaven gets to have her back.  I wish there had been two of her, so that one could still be here on Earth.  How many other families have had members killed by the virus?  How many of those families wonder why more wasn't done sooner rather than later?  Especially here in America and in Brazil?  But politics don't care about viruses, just as viruses don't care about politics.  Viruses are equal opportunity; they will infect anyone (any political group, any gender, any sexual orientation, any size, almost any age, any skin color, any language, any culture, any religion (or lack thereof), and any country).  Surely the influenza epidemic of 1918 taught the world something.  And before that, the Black Plague.  But some of us think that history is irrelevant.  That science is irrelevant.  And, because we're human, some of us forget (either willingly or from involuntary ignorance), and then we have to go through hell again ... and again ... and again.  I don't want to lose another relative to the virus (or a parent, or a brother, or a cousin, or an aunt, or an uncle).  But I guess I'd better prepare myself for that eventuality.  It's happened once, and there's no reason to think it won't happen again.  It could happen to me.  It could happen to you.  It could happen to any of us users here on YouTube.

A Crisis that started with the obviation of the 1934 \"Glass-Stegall Act\" written by Democrats Robert Rubin and Larry Summers, brought to the floor of the House by Phil Graham (Neo Con) and passed\u00a0in 1999 and signed by Bill Clinton. \nBTW, the FED came into power on Democrat Woodrow Wilson's watch in 1913. Democrats know how to bitch, but DON'T know how to research ZIP. You have a job? Thank Trump for stopping the \"Free Trade Agreements\" proposed by BHO and the Dems. The TTP and the TTIP, both designed to send more American jobs overseas like NAFTA, CAFTA and GATT, the FASCIST Free Trade Agreements that Clinton & Gore pushed through on their watch.\n\n\n\nIf you understood the application of the term \"The Hegelian Dialectic\" you would have grasped a long time ago that your \"solution\" is exactly what the Elite want: \"Ordo Ab Chao\".\nIt is known also as \"Thesis vs Antithesis = Synthesis\" or \"Problem Reaction, Solution\".\nThe ELITE cause the Problem and by public Reaction, they get the Solution they want, not yours. It's worked over and over again for hundreds of years. In Thesis vs Antithesis = Synthesis, the elite offer two or more scary false paradigms to the populace to achieve their objective, not yours.\n\n\n\nSocialism is the easy management system of Fascism and it is fostered by the Commodity Monopolists, the Oligarchs/Royal Bloodlines/Banking Houses of the Old World Order.\nThey use their \"Non Profit Foundations\" to control the educational systems (see: Reece Commission, Norman P Dodd, chief investigator) and the CFR to control all media.\n\n\n\n\nIt was once a requirement of all corporations to undergo periodic review for the purposes of getting their charters renewed in the States they were operating out of and they had to prove that they were operating in the best interests of the people.\n\n\nIn NJ, it was the Rockefellers (ESSO/S.O.) and in Delaware, it was the Du Pont's (both Illuminati Families) who first bribed and blackmailed the State Legislatures into foregoing this \"renewal process\".\nThey used their monopolies to control the political process of the Nation. In 1921, the CFR began to help this process along, the twin of Great Britain's \"Chatham House\", The Royal Institute of International Affairs. This is who Col House worked for as an adjunct to the Royal Court, where the HQ of World Freemasonry is located.\n\n\n\nWe were falsely taught that Fascism & Socialism are opposing forces and the \"right-left\" paradigm since high school by the Elite/MultiNational Corporations owned/controlled Non Profit Foundations. It is their mission to control education and it was investigated by the Reece Commission and their Chief Investigator, Norman P Dodd, in 1954. The Investigation was triggered by a complaint to the US Dept of Ed that \"the Illuminati\" were interfering with the State of California's Educational Curriculum, their words, not mine.\n\n\n\n\nIn the true political spectrum, the Extreme of \"right\" is Freedom to the point of Anarchy and no controls. Under a Constitutional Republic, we the people rule with Freedom by Law. This understanding has been lost to the people. We allowed criminals, lawyers working for the British Crown, to inhabit the US Congress. The original uS Constitution that predates \"The Act of 1871\" forbade Lawyers to hold office. Look up this and \"The United States IS a Corporation\".\n\n\n\n\nIn the Extreme \"left\" is No Freedoms to the point of a Totalitarian rule of Society.\nThe roads to get to a totalitarian state of Control are Democracies, Fascism, Socialism, Monarchies, Dictatorships and Oligarchies. But in reality, it is always Oligarchies, \"the power behind the throne\" that rule the left and the perceptions of the people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Non Profit Foundations and the CFR's purpose is to confuse these issues and manage the minds of the people.\n\"We shall have World Government, whether or not we like it.\nThe only question is whether World Government will be achieved\nby conquest or consent.\"\nby:\nJames Paul Warburg\n(1896-1969) son of Paul Moritz Warburg, nephew of Felix Warburg and of Jacob Schiff, both of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. which poured millions into the Russian Revolution through James' brother Max, banker to the German government, Chairman of the CFR\nSource:\nFebruary 17, 1950, appearance before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nThere is nothing in the American Free Enterprise System that resembles the Tyranny of Commodity Monopoly. \"Free Trade Agreements\" are Orwelian double speak. They are designed specifically to gut the middle class of America.\n\n\nWe are living under FASCISM\u00a0 since the first World War. We were the last bastion of hope for a free world.\nBefore the turn of the last century, Corporations were required to undergo review before their Charters were renewed and PROVE they were operating in the best interest of the American People. First with the Rockefeller's in NJ and then the Du Pont's of Delaware, this measure was deleted from protocols. These are only two of the Illuminati Bloodlines. Who runs these faceless corporations beyond their boards and CEO's/CFO's? One guess. 12 Corporations control the other \"Fortune 500\" Companies.\n\nPoorly read persons like yourself will drive America into the hands of perpetual Serfdom, and why not?

Pretends to be against the so called \u201cfake media\u201d while putting on a show & dramatic performance, manipulating them to push his own true hidden personal agendas. He\u2019s the media puppet master but has a hand Put-in his a$$ ALL the way being Putin\u2019s damn puppet. Playing with human lives like we are on some kinda Chess board & if we don\u2019t stop fighting amongst ourselves and start fighting TOGETHER against the real threats we are facing as Americans, then this clown\u2019s fake gold spray painted princess tiara will be replaced with his 20-24k crown of Hitler-like dictatorship.. metaphorically speaking on the crown.. Y2K20-Y2K24 (24k) golden crown on that overly inflated ugly head, with his drama queen sash needing elastic bands to fit his also overly inflated ego. Omg, this guy is a demonic entity of pure f\u2019n EVIL! It is all a big show for him. The reality TV star and his pathetic theatrics. He\u2019s such a child! Worse. I mean no offense to our beautiful American children, or any other child.. sorry, so sorry. He\u2019s an illiterate ANIMAL! You know how in the ocean we see schools of fish? That\u2019s to look bigger by swimming together to scare of predators. That\u2019s what we need to do. Stand together to ward of this predatory scum bag sucking the life, freedom & rights from our lives & just murdering our American pride & American spirit. He is killing the American Dream by killing us off, manipulating the media in an attempt to turn us against one another, divide and conquer. We are letting him win by feeding into the BS, falling victim to his mind games. What a convenient distraction & perfect timing, to get everyone fired up & in large groups forgetting about the deadly viral threat or so mad they didn\u2019t care anymore, just to spread the virus to the masses, the people participating in those huge events spreading it to innocent friends & family members back at home who wanted no part in the drama, were trying to stay home and stay safe, or if possible for them, go to work to pay for homes & buy food, then spreading the virus even further, Unintentionally because someone who took part in the events was in contact with them, and they got infected by others in the crowds, some asymptomatic or just not showing symptoms YET.. Trump in the background patting himself on the back (as per his usual, self praising, God Complex ways) just further contemplating how to add more spice to the mix. Reverse psychology, try to down talk some of the media platforms while using them to energize his twisted agenda to kill as many people as quickly as possible, mass murder & get away with it! He\u2019s got blood all over his filthy rich hands! Think about this, he didn\u2019t win the majority vote.. guaranteed it\u2019s possible that can certainly happen again! They tried to kick him out, he had his tantrums and got his way! We are stuck with him! He may very well be the end of this great country as we once knew it. Things are changing swiftly and it\u2019s terrifying. I\u2019m scared for our children & if they even have a future & get to have children, their futures! If voices have been heard through protests and so on, redirect that energy! If you\u2019re gonna risk lives to go out and riot and protest, how about looking at the bigger picture? Protest against that clown Trump! If you\u2019re gonna be loud and proud about something, be all loud and proud about being an American citizen and stand for the rights he is determined to rip away from us that our soldiers and vets have fought & even died for! It\u2019s probably the ONLY way we can win against his games, & Putin\u2019s master plans, whatever his motive may be.. Trump things he\u2019s really something, he\u2019s just an animated puppet. He is ridiculous. A crying shame to our Nation and everything we as Americans stand for. I\u2019m not a vet, my father, brother & husband are, though. They are all war vets. Not wannabe war-time hero\u2019s.. they actually did fight the American fight, unlike trump\u2019s self proclaimed \u201cwar-time\u201d presidency. Sad part is too many damn people worship him & praise his every illiterate word, the nonsensical garbage that spews from his mouth, toxic verbal debris.. yuk. They\u2019re blind and aren\u2019t awake yet. So I\u2019m no vet, but I serve my community directly, always help others, it\u2019s just my calling, but selfish, self-serving Trump only serves himself & is so cocky about it. He\u2019s a waste of time & is deteriorating our heritage. America is a very diversified country and that makes us a unique heritage. He IS a white privileged POS. To everyone out there sick or suffering in any way from the hardships brought upon us via the wrath of Trump, my broken, devastated heart goes out to you & your family. I do feel heartbroken. Positive vibes, best of intent & prayers for everyone. I hope to see y\u2019all on the other side of this battle, all living & in one piece. Survivors of the Trump plague & Corona virus area. Spread kindness, spread positivity. Have empathy & compassion & never give up.
